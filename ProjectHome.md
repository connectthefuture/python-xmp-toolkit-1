**Python XMP Toolkit** is a library for working with [XMP](http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp) metadata, as well as reading/writing XMP metadata stored in many different file formats.

Python XMP Toolkit is wrapping [Exempi ](http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi) (using [ctypes](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ctypes.html)), a C/C++ XMP library based on [Adobe XMP Toolkit](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/), ensuring that future updates to the XMP standard are easily incorporated into the library with a minimum amount of work.

Python XMP Toolkit has been developed by:
  * [ESA/Hubble - European Space Agency](http://www.spacetelescope.org)
  * [ESO - European Southern Observatory](http://www.eso.org)
  * [CRS4 - Centre for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia](http://www.crs4.it)

## Feature Overview ##
The XMP features provided are similar to that of Adobe XMP Toolkit, which are:

  * Support for parsing, manipulating, and serializing XMP data.
  * Support for locating the XMP in a file, adding XMP to a file, or updating the XMP in a file.
  * Support for nearly any file format with smart file handlers for JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, PSD, InDesign, MOV, MP3, MPEG2, MPEG4, AVI, FLV, SWF, ASF, PostScript, P2, SonyHDV, AVCHD, UCF, WAV, XDCAM, XDCAMEX.
  * An API very similar to Adobe XMP Toolkit, as well as more Pythonic methods as well.
  * Based on Exempi 2.1.1 and Adobe XMP Toolkit 4.4.2
